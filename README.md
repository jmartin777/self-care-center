# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

*** I built ,styled and provided functionality using HTML, Javascript and CSS togethor to create a website application. Within this website, the user has the option to choose an "Affirmation" or a "Mantra" option which generates a random saying considering the option the user chose. The user also has the capability to remove a message from the storage of phrases if there "not feeling" it (button) which helps customize the users scope of phrases they connect with.***

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

*** I would first provide them with the link to the main repository in which all working branches have been merged. Ask them to access the SSH code and 'git clone' down to their local terminal. From there they would open this directory in VS code / Atom. To access the site they would type  'open index.html' in their termianl to retrieve the HTML site itself. ***

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
