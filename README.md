# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

 I built ,styled and provided functionality using HTML, Javascript and CSS togethor to create a website application. Within this website, the user has the option to choose an "Affirmation" or a "Mantra" option which generates a random saying considering the option the user chose. The user also has the capability to remove a message from the storage of phrases if there "not feeling" it (button) which helps customize the users scope of phrases they connect with.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

 I would first provide them with the link to the main repository in which all working branches have been merged. Ask them to access the SSH code and 'git clone' down to their local terminal. From there they would open this directory in VS code / Atom. To access the site they would type  'open index.html' in their termianl to retrieve the HTML site itself. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was given to us on 12/13/22 and had to completed by 12/18/22.We were on our 3rd week of the Mod1 course- it took 6 days and a total of 21-24 hours on this project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals was to be able to build an HTML layout that was functionable, stylized with CSS and functionality using Javascript. We had to replicate the DOM of another site in comparison to our own in stylization. In doing so I was able to apply my knowledge and further the understanding of 'Flex' within CSS styles which helped me with the website layout and organzation of elements. Then I would apply insight into what the site was able to do and what features I would half to write functionality for in order for it to operate as a "Self-Care-Center.In order to manipulate the DOM from my Javascript , I had to maintain the order of 'parent-child' elements in my HTML and pinpoint them through Javascript and CSS. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

I felt this project really tested my knowledge of HTML, I had to build it from scratch and organize it according to a certain ordered protocol. This was a huge learning curve when it came to understanding the order of hierarchy of 'parent-child' elements and how to organize it in a way that allows us to interact with the DOM successfully using both CSS and Javascript applications. It really gave me a furthured perspective of how I look at the order of each of these applications togethor cohesively. This project really allowed me to use Dev-Tools in alot of ways when it came to the stylization and functionality. I was able to live-preview the site inputting different property-values using Dev-Tools and then replicate that into my CSS file to update my website as we progessed. I was also able to use 'Flex' live with Dev-tools to adjust and input different values and preview what that would look like. This really helped me get a visual preview and advantage when it came to stylizing with CSS and how to adjust and build off of the main-axis of a page. This really saved me alot of time when it came to CSS layout(the back and forth of input between the CSS.file and the site preview) and made the process alot more fluid.Alot of the challenges I faced came up when I was trying to access certain aspects of the HTML when it came to class and ids and how I organized my HTML in a way that would allow me to have the desired effect. I persoanlly got stuck right at the end of Iteration.2(Delete message) trying to pinpoint the input from my mantras/affirmations data-model within my HTML (display box element). I couldnt figure out how to considering the syntax of my function and what I was pulling from my HTML as a selector to have the desired effect-BUT the logic was there and how to do that!
